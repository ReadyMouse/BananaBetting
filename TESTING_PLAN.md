## Test Flow 6: Event Settlement & Payout Distribution

### Objective
Test event settlement and payout distribution using sendmany transaction.

### Test Setup for Simplified Testing
To avoid creating multiple small accounts that need to be drained later, we'll use different shielded addresses from the same test wallet for:
- **Event Creator**: `zs1test_creator_address...`
- **Validators**: `zs1test_validator1_address...`, `zs1test_validator2_address...`
- **Platform Fee**: `zs1test_platform_address...`
- **Charity Donation**: `taddress`

### Test Steps
1. **Event Settlement**
   - Navigate to event settlement page
   - Select the test event with placed bets
   - Set event outcome (e.g., "Team A Wins")
   - Submit settlement

2. **Payout Processing**
   - Click "Process Payouts" button
   - System should calculate distributions:
     - Winners: Proportional share of pool
     - Event Creator: Fee percentage
     - Validators: Validation rewards
     - Platform: Service fee

3. **Sendmany Execution**
   - System executes single sendmany transaction
   - Multiple outputs to different addresses
   - Record the master transaction hash

### Expected Results
- Event successfully settled
- Payout calculations correct
- Single sendmany transaction processes all distributions
- All recipients receive correct amounts

### Transaction Records
| Action | Transaction ID | Address | Amount | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Settlement Payout | `[TO_BE_RECORDED]` | Pool â†’ Multiple Recipients | Various | ðŸ”„ Pending | Sendmany distribution |
| Winner Payout | Same as above | Pool â†’ Winner | ~4.25 ZEC | ðŸ”„ Pending | Winner's share |
| Creator Fee | Same as above | Pool â†’ Creator | ~0.25 ZEC | ðŸ”„ Pending | Event creator fee |
| Validator Rewards | Same as above | Pool â†’ Validators | ~0.30 ZEC | ðŸ”„ Pending | Validation incentives |
| Platform Fee | Same as above | Pool â†’ Platform | ~0.20 ZEC | ðŸ”„ Pending | Service fee |
